				<li>Burger</li>
				<p>
					A hamburger or burger is an American fast food. It is a type
					of sandwich with a patty of cooked ground meat between the
					two halves of a bun. Tomatoes, onions, cheese, salad and
					dips may also be added. The hamburger may be eaten without a
					knife and fork, so it is a fast food which can be eaten
					anywhere.
				</p>
				<li>Pasta</li>
				<p>
					Pasta is a type of food typically made from an unleavened
					dough of wheat flour mixed with water or eggs, and formed
					into sheets or other shapes, then cooked by boiling or
					baking. Rice flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils, are
					sometimes used in place of wheat flour to yield a different
					taste and texture, or as a gluten-free alternative. Pasta is
					a staple food of Italian cuisine.
				</p>
				<li>Pizza</li>
				<p>
					Pizza is a dish of Italian origin, made with an oven-baked,
					flat, generally round bread that is often covered with
					tomatoes or a tomato-based sauce and mozzarella cheese.
					Other toppings are added according to region, culture, or
					personal preference. Originating as a part of Italian
					cuisine, the dish has become popular in many different parts
					of the world, particularly the United States, where numerous
					varieties have been developed, pizza restaurant chains have
					flourished, and pizza has become a home delivery item as
					well as being available as a frozen food ready to bake at
					home.
